# Valorant Analysis
## Project summary
Valorant is a tactical shooter game in which five players compete against one other. You should plant the spike and defand it from the opposing team to win the game. There are various agents, each with their own set of skills.
I wanted to analyze my performance during competitive matches for this project. Riot doesn't have any public apis, therefore I had to come up with a technique to retrieve my data profile, thus I utilized tracker gg and loaded my data through its api. After loading the data, I began analyzing it with Jupiter Notebook; I explain the entire procedure in the video below.
